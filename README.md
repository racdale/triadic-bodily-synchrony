Raw body-movement data sample and analysis scripts for submission:

-- Dale, R., Bryant, G. A., Manson, J. H., & Gervais, M. M. (submitted). Body synchrony in triadic interaction. 

`MAIN_SCRIPT.R` begins the overall analysis, and calls upon a number of scripts, including `functions.R`, containing some key functions, and `combineMansonData.R` which integrates the individual differences measures. `plotCCF.R` generates some detailed plots from the manuscript of the cross-correlation function.
